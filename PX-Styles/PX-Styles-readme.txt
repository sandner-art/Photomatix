Selection of styles for A1111, SD, and SDXL models. 

Installation:
Copy to your \stable-diffusion-webui folder and refresh the style list. Back up your original styles.csv if needed.

Contents:
1. General styles for SDXL
2. PX (Photomatix SD Model) styles 
3. PX styles using Barnum Camera TI sets
4. PX NEGATIVE experimental styles 
5. AX (Animatix) experimental styles 
6. CX (Cinematix) SDXL experimental styles

Styles are tested and finetuned for the respective models. However, the styles should generally work with most models.
Combinations of styles (PX/AX/CX) work well, but sometimes duplicate tokens may occur. In this case, use the "Apply all selected styles to prompt" button
and edit the prompt accordingly. PX Embeddings may not work as expected in SDXL.
Some longer PX styles are kept in the style list for reference.
