## Installation
Download and unzip all files (use the green <> Code button and Download zip option).
### Styles
Copy the styles.csv into your \stable-diffusion-webui folder. Backup your original file if there is any.
### Wildcards
You need Dynamic Prompts extension to use wildcards in A1111. After installing Dynamic Prompts, copy the wildcards folder into stable-diffusion-webui\extensions\sd-dynamic-prompts\wildcards. Refresh the list in Wildcards Manager tab.
### Barnum Camera
Copy the files to stable-diffusion-webui\embeddings folder and refresh the list of Textual Inversions. Barnum Camera is a set of highly versatile embeddings for stylized synthetic studio photography.
### Vectorscope-CC Styles
Install [Vectorscope Extension](https://github.com/Haoming02/sd-webui-vectorscope-cc/tree/main). Copy the file to \stable-diffusion-webui\extensions\sd-webui-vectorscope-cc. Vectorscope-CC is an extension modifying diffusion regarding color, brightness, and contrast.
